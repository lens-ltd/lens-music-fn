## General Principles
- Lyrics must be accurate and match the audio verbatim.
- Include everything that is an integral part of the song (primarily vocals, but also spoken phrases or sampled content).

## General Formatting
- The structure of the song should dictate the lyric's format.
- Lyrics should reflect the lyrical construction, progression, and natural cadence of the song.

### Line Breaks vs Section Breaks
- Use single spacing for lyric lines.
- Use double spacing to separate stanzas.

Indicators for line or section breaks:
- Changes in beat/rhythm
- Changes in song tempo
- Changes in lyric delivery method (e.g., singing to rapping)
- Defined chorus or hook

## Capitalization
Follow traditional English grammar rules:
- Capitalize proper nouns
- Capitalize the first letter of each lyric line
- Capitalize yelling or screaming (use sparingly)

Always capitalize:
- Divinity and religious terms in religious songs (e.g., "God, You, Him, Your")
- Acronyms
- Geographical locations (e.g., East Coast, Southside)
- First letter of words in parentheses

## Punctuation
- Keep punctuation minimal
- Follow traditional English grammar rules
- No periods or commas at the end of lyric lines
- Use exclamation points, question marks, and quotation marks as needed
- Use commas mid-line as needed
- Do not repeat punctuation for emphasis (e.g., no "!!!" or "???")

Acceptable punctuation:
- Hyphens: for dropped words, spelled-out words, and acronyms (e.g., L-Y-R-I-C-S)
- Parentheses: for background vocals
- Apostrophes: for slang and contractions (e.g., 'Rari for Ferrari)
- Periods: for acronyms commonly delimited with periods (e.g., F.B.I.)

## Repeated Lines
- Use ellipses (....) to represent fadeout at the end of a song
- This is the only acceptable use of ellipses in transcriptions

## Spoken Word Content
- Do not transcribe spoken word/conversational content within a song

## Background Vocals
- Format in parentheses
- Transcribe only if they add to the song's content (narratively or stylistically)
- Capitalize the first word in parentheses
- Do not put featured artist content in parentheses

## Non-Word Vocal Sounds
- Transcribe sparingly, only if they add to the song's content
- Transcribe easily identifiable non-words spoken by artists
- Do not transcribe improvised scatting
- Transcribe harmonious non-word vocal sounds

Examples of harmonious sounds:
- Ooh, Ah, Oh, Whoa, Mmm, Ha, La, Da, Do, De

Examples of stylized sounds:
- Skrrt, Burr, Brrr, Rah, Rrr, Woo!, Pow!, Shh, Blaow!

Do not include computer-generated sound effects

## Samples and Sampled Content
- Transcribe if it supports the lyrical content of the song
- Include electronic or reproduced audio that adds value to the lyrical content

## Clean and Explicit Lyrics
- Use 'Clean' only if there's a corresponding explicit version
- Represent dropped and edited content with asterisks

Examples:
- Explicit: Transcribe as heard
- Partially censored: Include audible part and replace omitted letters with asterisks
- Fully censored: Replace entire word with four asterisks (****)

## Live Versions
- Include spoken parts in live versions if they don't overlap with the song or disrupt its main flow

## Special Cases
- Transcribe lyrics in languages different from the primary language of the song in the original language, not phonetically`;
